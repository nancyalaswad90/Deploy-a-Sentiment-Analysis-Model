# SageMaker Deployment Project









 - The **notebook and Python files**  provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 





 - This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.





Please see the README in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
